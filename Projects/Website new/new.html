                    <h2>The phrase a couple of, meaning “a small number of; a few; several,” has been in standard use
                        for centuries, especially with measurements of time and distance and in referring to amounts of
                        money: They walked a couple of miles in silence. Repairs will probably cost a couple of hundred
                        dollars. The phrase is used in all but the most formal speech and writing. The shortened phrase
                        a couple, without of ( The gas station is a couple miles from here ), is an Americanism of
                        recent development that occurs chiefly in informal speech or representations of speech,
                        especially when followed by number terms (as a couple dozen eggs ) or units of measurement (as a
                        couple years ago; a couple gallons of gas ). This use of couple (as an adjective or modifier) is
                        still disliked by many. Without a following noun, a couple is even more informal: Jack shouldn't
                        drive. It's clear he's had a couple. (Here the noun drinks is omitted.)
                        In referring to two people, couple, like many collective nouns, may take either a singular or a
                        plural verb. Most commonly, it is construed as a plural: The couple were traveling to Texas. See
                        also collective noun.</h2>

            <span>Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime
                virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. An example of this
                range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the
                love for food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional
                attachment.</span>
